Welcome to Encapsulating EF Core Usage
=====================

This is the source code for my Pluralsight course Encapsulating EF Core Usage [link is coming soon][L1]

How to Get Started
--------------

Create a database using the [Database-initial.sql][L3] script, modify the connection string in [appsettings.json][L4], and you are good to go!

Source code for each module
---------------------------

Source code for each module is tagged and available on the [Releases tab][L2]. For example, tag "module-3-encapsulating-the-dbcontext" indicates the state of the sample project at the start of module 3, which is titled "Encapsulating the DbContext"
